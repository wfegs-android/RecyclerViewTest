### RecylerView Sample Test


### Instructions
Create titles and images in a Recycler view. The album title and images should be retrieved from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The project already contains a base URL (the one above!) and endpoint URLs for this task.


You are free to change but coding should be in Kotlin MVVM and test driven.

NOTE: The code in its current state does not compile, _that's on purpose:_ on a real-world project you might need to pick up code from another member of your team and continue from where they left off, and they may not have completed their thought.

### 
  If there's a library that will help you get the job done, use it!  Android apps are frequently built using a wide variety of open-source libraries.

  Use free apis or create static json for development purpose

  Try to use latest android development tools, Sample base code contain latest development libs
